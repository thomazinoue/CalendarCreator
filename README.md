# CalendarCreator
When I was studying at EIP, one of my teachers found out I was a Software Developer backhome. After a few meetings at school, he mentioned that there was a calendar of the course that they had to create for every single course from school by hand. Also, there was a rule that every ten weeks of classes the school would give three weeks of holidays and also considering the public holidays throughout the year.Then I propose to create a simple desktop application that could save a few hours for every teacher.
Basically, in the app you fill a form with the name of the course, what year it starts and finishes, what days the classes are and in the text box you fill the name of every unit that this course has. Considering that if the unit takes more than a week it should be two lines with the same name, as the app will split the units every line skipped (enter) the user does.
